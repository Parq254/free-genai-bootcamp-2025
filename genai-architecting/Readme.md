## Functional Requirements

The company intends to invest in owning their infrastructure due to concerns about user data privacy and the potential increase in the cost of managed GenAI services.

They plan to invest in an AI PC with a budget of $10-15K. The company currently has 300 active students, all located in Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We assume that the selected open-source LLMs will be capable of running efficiently on hardware purchased within the $10-15K budget.

A single server in our office will be connected to the internet, providing sufficient bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy

To address concerns about copyrighted materials, we will purchase and store necessary materials in our database for student access.
Considerations

We are considering IBM Granite, a truly open-source model with traceable training data, to avoid copyright issues and ensure transparency in the model's operations.
