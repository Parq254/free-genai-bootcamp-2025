## Bootcamp Overview:
The Bootcamp is designed to;
* Understand the capabilities & limitations of GenAI.
* Apply GenAI to real-world business cases through projects.
* Learn to architect & deploy GenAI workloads effectively.

## Business Scenario:
I've been hired as an AI Engineer for a Korean Hagwon (Language Learning Center) to:

* Expand language learning through AI-powered applications.
* Enhance student engagement between instructor-led classes.
* Leverage AI for personalized English-Korean language practice.
Many students struggle with real-world English fluency due to a lack of interactive, personalized practice. These AI-powered apps aim to bridge that gap.

## Planned Application:
* **Daily Life Visual Novel Generator**: A town-based learning app where users engage in daily routine conversations with variation.
* **Korean Text Adventure**: A story-driven language learning game that gradually introduces vocabulary and grammar.
* **English-Korean Sentence Constructor**: Helps users translate English sentences into Korean through guided AI feedback.
* **Sign to Speak**: A KSL (Korean Sign Language) learning app that uses a webcam to recognize fingerspelling.
* **Subtitles to Vocabulary**: Extracts new vocabulary words from movie subtitle files for efficient learning.
* **Speech to Learn**: Provides real-time feedback on pronunciation and fluency in a target language.

## Accounts & Platforms:
* **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP
* **AI/ML**: Hugging Face, Lightning.AI, Intel Tiber Developer Cloud, CIVO
* **Dev & Deployment**: GitHub, Gitpod, Codespaces, MongoDB, Lucid Charts, Vercel/v0
