The purpose of this project is to leverage AI-driven solutions to enhance the learning experience for students at a Language Learning School that teaches Korean and Haitian Creole. This AI system aims to broaden the range of language offerings and provide valuable resources for students to practice and improve their language skills outside of instructor-led classes.

## Key Features:
Extend Language Offerings: Utilize AI to diversify and enrich the language curriculum.
Interactive Learning Tools: Develop AI-powered tools to support language learning, such as speech recognition, grammar correction, and personalized learning recommendations.
Augmented Learning Experience: Allow students to continue their learning journey between live classes with AI-driven chatbots, quizzes, and practice exercises tailored to their proficiency level.

## Project Aims:
** Empower students to learn languages effectively and independently.
** Enhance student engagement through AI-based tools.
** Expand language options to foster multilingual learning and cultural diversity.
